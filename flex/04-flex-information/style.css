I guess this didn't need to a flex container either. Text-align on the body centered
all the text AND the images.

  flex-direction: column;
  Makes the img and txt stack on top of each other vertically

Didn't need this because not turning each of .container's flex items into their own containers
just made them behave as normal CSS/HTML block element that stacked on top of each other...

  align-items: center;
  Makes the flex items center horizontally on the cross axis bc flex-direction
  is set to column
  
Again, unnecessary bc didn't need each .info group to be flex containers...

Didn't need to target .text because putting text-align: center on the body made all text
including the title center without extra code.
